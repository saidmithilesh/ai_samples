# Lesson Plan

**Subject:** Biology

**Grade Level:** Class 11 (CBSE Curriculum)

**Topic:** Cell: The Unit of Life

**Learning Framework:** 5E Model

**Learning Outcomes:**

* **Knowledge-based:** Students will acquire deep knowledge about prokaryotic cells.

**Materials:**

* Microscope
* Prepared slides of prokaryotic cells
* Textbook
* Whiteboard or projector
* Markers or pens
* Handouts

**Procedure:**

**Engage (10 minutes)**

* Begin by showing students a slide of a prokaryotic cell under a microscope.
* Ask students to observe the cell and make any initial observations.
* Discuss the importance of cells as the basic unit of life.

**Explore (15 minutes)**

* Divide students into small groups.
* Provide each group with a handout describing the characteristics of prokaryotic cells.
* Have students work together to identify and discuss the key features of prokaryotic cells.
* Encourage students to ask questions and share their observations.

**Explain (20 minutes)**

* After students have explored the characteristics of prokaryotic cells, bring the class together for a guided explanation.
* Use the whiteboard or projector to display a diagram of a prokaryotic cell.
* Explain the structure and function of each major component, including:
    * Cell membrane
    * Cytoplasm
    * Ribosomes
    * Nucleoid
    * Flagellum (if present)

**Elaborate (15 minutes)**

* Divide students into pairs.
* Provide each pair with a prepared slide of a prokaryotic cell.
* Have students work together to draw and label the major components of the cell.
* Encourage students to compare their drawings with the diagram presented during the explanation.

**Evaluate (10 minutes)**

* Have students complete a short quiz to assess their understanding of prokaryotic cells.
* Collect students' drawings and provide feedback on their accuracy and completeness.
* Lead a class discussion to summarize the key concepts covered in the lesson.

**Differentiation:**

* For struggling students, provide additional support during the Explore and Elaborate stages.
* For advanced students, challenge them with more complex questions and encourage them to research specific aspects of prokaryotic cells.

**Assessment:**

* Quiz
* Student drawings
* Class participation
